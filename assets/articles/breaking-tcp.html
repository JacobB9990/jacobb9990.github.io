            <h3 id="what-is-transmission-control-protocol">What is Transmission Control Protocol</h3>
            <p>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transport-layer protocol from the 1970s, a part of the TCP/IP
                model. It ensures reliable data transfer through a three-way handshake between client and host. TCP
                includes rigorous safety checks, such as error detection, sequencing, flow control, and congestion
                control, making it challenging to break.</p>
            <h3 id="how-could-we-break-tcp">How could we &quot;Break&quot; TCP</h3>
            <p>While TCP is extremely rigorous, it is not perfect because that is impossible. There are several ways to
                potentially disrupt TCP. One way is we can use programs to simulate poor network conditions, such as the
                <code>tc</code> (Traffic Control) tool in Linux. We can also block Wi-Fi signals by finding a location
                with weak connectivity or by placing obstacles between the router and devices. Additionally, I can
                overload the network with heavy data traffic, such as streaming videos and connecting multiple devices,
                to create bottlenecks. In the real world, these conditions are all possible, and common, but often occur
                at random. In this experiment I am just going to press "Ctrl + C" for convenience's sake.
            </p>
            <h2 id="method">Method</h2>
            <p>I have created a straightforward program that transfers a file from my computer, which is connected to a
                switch via Ethernet, to my laptop over Wi-Fi. The image is just a picture of a mountain. I then will
                press &quot;Ctrl + C&quot; on the client side, which will terminate the program. From there, I will
                observe and record the results by using Wireshark, an amazing tool to capture network packets.</p>
            <h3 id="analyzing-tcp-handshake-and-congestion-flags-with-wireshark">Analyzing TCP Handshake and Congestion
                Flags with Wireshark</h3>
            <p>I used Wireshark to track and analyze the network traffic during a file transfer. I started by setting up
                a server and then launched the client to begin the transfer. I stopped the program shortly after the
                transfer began to examine what Wireshark had recorded.
                The results showed a smooth TCP three-way handshake with SYN, SYN&amp;ACK, and ACK packets exchanged in
                order. This handshake is crucial for setting up a reliable connection between the client and server.
                During the session, I also noted the presence of additional TCP flags: ECE, CWR, and ECN.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>ECE (Explicit Congestion Notification Echo)</strong>: which is used to signal the
                        presence of congestion to the sender.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>CWR (Congestion Window Reduced)</strong>: sent by the sender to acknowledge receipt of
                        the ECE signal and confirm that it has adjusted its congestion window accordingly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification)</strong>: aimed at minimizing packet loss due to
                        network congestion. It provides an early warning to endpoints about impending congestion,
                        allowing them to reduce their sending rate and avoid packet drops.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="/assets/images/WiresharkSYNACK.png" height="150">
            <p>Seeing these flags in action gives a clear look at how TCP handles congestion. It shows how the protocol
                adapts to network issues to try and prevent packet loss.
                When the transfer ended, we saw the FIN flag, which normally means the connection is closing. However,
                the file did not finish transferring before we stopped the session. The last flag we saw was RST
                (Reset),
                which essentially tells the connection to &quot;stop immediately.&quot;
                Comparing images before and after the transfer, it was clear there was a drop in quality. This
                highlights
                how network issues can affect data transfer and the final result.</p>

            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In the end, this experiment provided valuable information on how TCP transmits data from one end to the
                other. And we also gained a great insight on what happens when something goes wrong. The network I was
                connected to did have some potential congestion and TCP recognized that and provided the proper flags to
                try to mitigate those issues. However, the transfer was doomed from the start. One thing I did not
                realize was that once I terminated the process, the JPEG image was all there, but just pixelated towards
                the
                bottom.</p>
